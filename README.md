Keep the ball rolling, existence and time over upvotes and retweets! LA Hacks 201

Basic idea is that upvotes and retweets dominate a lot of social information and such constructs cloud our conceptions of
what really makes up quality in a post, a tweet, a status, etc.

By getting rid of upvotes and likes and using timed existence as the quantitative scale that measures information, one can
focus more on the significance of a trend or a hashtag, rather than focusing on the number of likes or shares it currently has.

Everything on Snowball is ephemeral. A post that's available one day might not be available the next. It's fun, it's 
adventurous, and it's the present. It's Snowball.

Keep the ball rolling, existence and time over upvotes and retweets! LA Hacks 2015

Basic idea is that upvotes and retweets dominate a lot of social information and such constructs cloud our conceptions of
what really makes up quality in a post, a tweet, a status, etc.

By getting rid of upvotes and likes and using timed existence as the quantitative scale that measures information, one can
focus more on the significance of a trend or a hashtag, rather than focusing on the number of likes or shares it currently has.

If you see a piece of information - or a "Snowball" - that interests you, keep it rolling! Velocity signfies the overall traction a trend, post, or status is currently getting. The higher the velocity, the more likely it will stay alive and not self-destruct. If a Snowball reaches 0 velocity, it melts and disappears from the network. Whatever value that Snowball had in
the past is apparently not relevent to the users of this network. But no worries if you wrote that one: just pack up some
more snow with that keyboard, and keep it rolling down the hill.

Additionally, keeping track of a Snowball's score will give you an idea of how popular it is. If one has a high score, it's been alive for a very long time, and must be pretty popular if people want to keep it alive.

Everything on Snowball is ephemeral. A post that's available one day might not be available the next. It's fun, it's 
adventurous, and it's the present. It's Snowball.
